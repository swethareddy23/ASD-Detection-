# Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection 
## Introduction
* Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental
disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn,
and behave.</br>
* Autism is known as a “spectrum” disorder because there is wide variation
in the type and severity of symptoms people experience.
Objective
Design a deep learning based model architecture to predict if a child has
ASD or NOT, based on the–
1. fMRI data
2.Facial Expression.
Also planing to provide an AI/AR/VR-based real-time solution to detect
ASD in children between the ages of 6 to 12.
